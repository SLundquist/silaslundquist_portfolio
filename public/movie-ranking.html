          <h2 class="movieTitle">Interstellar</h2>
          <h3>What it's about:</h3>
          <p>
            Interstellar tells the story of a man and his crew who venture out into space in an attempt to find a new home for humanity. They must
            make sacrifices and hard decisions, denying themselves and putting the future of humanity before their own safety and comfort.
          </p>
          <h3>Why I like it:</h3>
          <p>
            Besides the captivating story and well-paced plot, the cinematography of the film is perfect, vividly painting a realistic environment. I
            also enjoyed the tension between characters throughout the plot, highlighting both their good and bad sides and leading to personal growth
            in the end.

        <div class="movie2">
          <h2 class="movieTitle">Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</h2>
          <h3>What it's about:</h3>
          <p>
            Miles Moralis, a teenage boy living in Brooklyn becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a radioactive spider. After learning to use his
            newfound abilities (which include invisibility, web-making, and more), Miles works with spider friends to save Brooklyn from a collider.
          </p>
          <h3>Why I like it:</h3>
          <p>
            The movie is an absolute masterclass in 2d and 3d animation, having raised the bar for hand-animated film across the movie industry. I
            really like how the movie uses multiple film techniques throughout the story to convey different ideas and feeling to the viewer. Besides
            this, the plot and story of the film is very good, making Miles truly stand out as a hero in the end.

        <div class="movie3">
          <h2 class="movieTitle">Dune 2</h2>
          <h3>What it's about:</h3>
          <p>
            Dune 2 is the second film of the Dune series. It continues to tell the story of a boy who is destined to be the savior of an oppressed
            people on a desert planet, Arakis.
          </p>
          <h3>Why I like it:</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoyed the sci-fi elements of the movie, especially the creative animals and vehicles that locals used. This element as well as the
            amazing cinematography stood out and made the story even better.
